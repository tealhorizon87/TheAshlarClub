## UX
This is the main website The Ashlar Club, a light blues club for Sussex freemasonry. The site is designed to be a central forum for members to find out about upcomming events and to interact with the commitee, as well as providing information for prospective members.

### User Stories
- As a general user, I expect -
    - to be able to easily navigate around the site
    - to be able to view the site from any device size

#### Member stories
- As a member, I want
    - to easily view a calendar of upcoming events
    - to be able to book onto events directly from the site
    - to 'meet' the committee in charge
    - to be able to send queries and suggestions to the committee directly from the site

#### Guest user stories
- As a guest, I want
    - to understand what the website is for
    - to find information about what the club does
    - to view feedback from members about the club
    - to 'meet' the committee in charge
    - to be able to ask questions or sign up for the club directly from the site

### Design

The site is designed with five pages - a landing page, about us, events, contact us, useful links and past events. The menu tab is available on every page to allow the user to navigate from any page to any other page. 

The font families used for the project are Oswald for all headings, and Lato for the main body text.

This application is designed for freemasonry and as such, the colour pallette represents the 'light blue' and 'dark blue' used in freemasonry, with some accent colours for contrast. The colour palette used to generate all colours in the project was generated by [coolors](https://coolors.co/).

## Features
- The site is fully responsive by using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
- The site is easy to navigate by using the navbar in the header if each page, and by making the headings in the about section links to the relevant page.
- A table is used to display upcoming events in the events page.

### Future Features
- Add a members page with more specific information targeted at a regular user.
- Add a login/sign up modal to access the members section.
