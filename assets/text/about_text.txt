<p>The Ashlar club was founded to give Freemasons and their families in the north of Sussex a means to meet and socialise outside the regular meetings of their lodges.</p>

<p>Our principal effort is to provide and organise events of various types aimed at the newer members of the fraternity, to encourage involvment and an atmosphere of brotherhood.</p>
